# identifier is a unique name used to define a runway usage configuration later in this file

# glideslope is the angle in degrees; the default value is 3.0
# localizer is the true heading in degrees of the ILS until touchdown; by default it's the same as runway true heading, but a small offset is allowed
# beacon is an optional point on the localizer at a certain distance (NM) from the (displaced) threshold
# second beacon is a point on the localizer when runway is used in opposite direction (rev)
# tower frequency is used for handoff readbacks

## name, amount, planetype, pronunciation, <direction>
# name is the 3 letter airline code, or a private regristration (with a land code, dash(-), and then the format)
# amount determines the relative likelihood of appearance (e.g. 0=never, 0.1=rarely, 1=occasionally, 10=frequently, etc)
# planetype determines the plane characteristics (optionally put a dash (/) between multiple types)
# pronuniation is the (airline) callsign
# direction lets the plane arrive/depart in (roughly) a preferred direction:
# give the direction as a string containing one or more of the letters nwse, for north west south east,
# but make sure there are actually entrypoints defined at those directions (approximately); w needs an entrypoint near 270
# tip: you can add the same airline multiple times, for example with different planetypes, in order to get different likelihoods per planetype

# usage is a string (without spaces) that may contain these words: start, land, rev, int, track
# where rev means reversed use (opposite direction), int means intersection departure (takeoffs begin 30% down the rwy), track means backtrack after landing
# offsetheading means planes will fly a specific heading just after takeoff (especially useful for allowing parallel takeoffs with divergent climbout headings)
# nosid option means planes will depart on the given offsetheading, with SID mode disabled
# the list must be ordered with increasing score values (as in this example 0, 7, 8)
# when rwy configurations are omited, two configs are automatically created, one for each rwy direction, with all runways active
